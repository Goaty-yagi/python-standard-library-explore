# Python AST Playground

Welcome to the Python AST Playground! This directory serves as a playground for exploring Abstract Syntax Trees in Python. Experiment with AST basics, manipulation techniques, custom transformations, and visualize AST structures.Â¥

## About Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)

[AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) are hierarchical data structures that represent the syntactic structure of source code in a programming language. They are a crucial component in the compilation process and are commonly used in programming language parsers, compilers, and static code analysis tools.
